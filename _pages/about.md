My name is Itamar Johan Rachailovich. I am interested in science, medicine, statistics, history, and politics. As of November 2024 I am very new to the computer science and  related environments. I have a degree in both Biology and in Psychology both with honors. Here, I intend to post scientific materials, stuff that I find intereting, and even politics, despite the fact that I am apolitical person, and think that politics mostly separate the hearts and turn people against each other, however, some issues are beyond politics per se, and should be discussed, such as genocides that take place anywhere in the world, oppression, discrimination and offences against what most human consider and have alwayed concidered to be human rights.
